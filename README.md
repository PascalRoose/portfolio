## About

The goal of this project is to create a portfolio website that showcases some of my projects and skills. 
While I'm at it, I'm also learning some new technologies and techniques by building this website.

## Roadmap

Here are some of the things I want to add to this project to learn more about them:

- [ ] Set up a custom domain for the website
- [ ] Add an about me section to the website
- [ ] Add a projects' section in an interactive way
- [ ] Add a blog section to the website
- [ ] Add a contact form to the website
- [ ] Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
- [ ] Set up automatic deployment to Google App Engine 
- [ ] Set up a Google Kubernetes Engine cluster to host the website
- [ ] Change automatic deployment to use the kubernetes cluster
